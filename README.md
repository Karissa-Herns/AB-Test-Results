# AB-Test-Results
In this project, I was expected to take a complex dataset perform A/B testing to help the company understand if they should implement their new webpage,
keep the old webpage, or run the experiment longer. I was expected to make inferences about the relationship between conversion rates and the treatment and control web pages.
